## Use SSH authentication with a repo on GitHub

### Instructions: 
```
Delete the key in the .ssh folder, on GitHub too, re-do everything done in the code along (see recording if needed). As you do...

    Document/explain the steps / commands you used
    Include a labelled/annotated diagram of what you've learn (Suggestion: draw your own)
    Use a new repo called tech501-ssh (or a new section in an existing repo)
    Suggestion: include some screenshots
    Timeframe: Send link to repo to all trainers by <insert time>

Reminders:

    Never put your SSH keys or the .ssh folder inside of a Git repo
    Make sure you are not in your .ssh folder for any other reason than to generate SSH keys or cat the contents of a public key
```
