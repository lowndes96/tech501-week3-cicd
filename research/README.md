# What is CI? Benefits?
![read-hat cicd workflow image](../images/ci-cd-flow-desktop.png.webp)
- CI stands for **continuous intergration** and is the practice of automating and frequently intergrating code changes into a shared source code repository 
<br>
--- 
Aim: 

- streamline and accelerate th esoftware development lifecycle 
<br>
benefits: 

- helps organizations avoid bugs and code failures (easyer to pinpoint bugs - visability of code, and addition in small chunks)
- as updates are made, automated testing steps are triggered to ensure the reliability of merged code change (avoids working in isolation, avoids 'merge day')
- features of CI/CD can help decrease complexity (small steps implemented one at a time)
- automates the manual human intervention traditionally needed to get new code from a commit into production, downtime is minimized and code releases happen faster

# What is CD? Benefits?

- CD stands for **continuous delivery** 
- Continuous delivery usually means a developerâ€™s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository (github or container)

# Difference between CD and CDE
* CD = continuous delivery 
* CDE = continuous deployment 

Continuous delivery automates the software release process up to the point of a production environment, requiring a manual approval to deploy to live production, while continuous deployment fully automates the entire process, deploying every change to production automatically without manual intervention; essentially, continuous delivery is a stepping stone to the more aggressive continuous deployment approach where every successful build is automatically released to production. 
<br>

#### Key differences: 
**Manual approval:** <br>
* Continuous delivery includes a manual approval step before deploying to production, whereas continuous deployment does not.
**Risk level:** <br>
* Continuous deployment carries a higher risk of deploying potentially unstable code to production due to its fully automated nature, while continuous delivery provides a safety net with manual review. 
**When to use each:** <br>
**Continuous delivery:** <br>
* Suitable for applications where a higher level of control is needed before deploying to production, such as highly regulated industries or critical systems. 
**Continuous deployment:** <br>
* Ideal for applications with robust automated testing and monitoring where rapid iteration and frequent releases are desired.
