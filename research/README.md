# What is CI? Benefits?
![read-hat cicd workflow image](../images/ci-cd-flow-desktop.png.webp)
- CI stands for **continuous intergration** and is the practice of automating and frequently intergrating code changes into a shared source code repository 
<br>
--- 
Aim: 

- streamline and accelerate th esoftware development lifecycle 
<br>
benefits: 

- helps organizations avoid bugs and code failures (easyer to pinpoint bugs - visability of code, and addition in small chunks)
- as updates are made, automated testing steps are triggered to ensure the reliability of merged code change (avoids working in isolation, avoids 'merge day')
- features of CI/CD can help decrease complexity (small steps implemented one at a time)
- automates the manual human intervention traditionally needed to get new code from a commit into production, downtime is minimized and code releases happen faster

# What is CD? Benefits?

- CD stands for **continuous delivery** 
- Continuous delivery usually means a developerâ€™s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository (github or container)
